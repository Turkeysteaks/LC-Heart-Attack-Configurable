### ALL CREDITS TO ORIGINAL MOD: https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/nono_t27/HeartAttack/ 

This mod adds in a slim chance (default 5%) for the player to instantly die upon getting scared, and a slightly bigger chance (default 13%) for the player to suffer effects instead.

The heart attack and tremble can be individually modified by config.

Trembling causes lower movement speed for a short period of time.

## Roadmap:
- [x] Change heart attack chance via config
- [x] Chance tremble chance via config
- [x] Change tremble move speed via config
- [ ] Change heart attack from instant kill to just damage
- [ ] Introduce extra effects for both heart attack and tremble
- [ ] Use a specific cause of death that works with Coroner
