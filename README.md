# Heart Attack
## But configurable

This mod adds in a slim chance (default 5%) for the player to instantly die upon getting scared, and a slightly bigger chance (default 13%) for the player to suffer effects instead.

The heart attack and tremble can be individually modified by config.

Trembling causes lower movement speed for a short period of time.

## Roadmap:
- [x] Change heart attack chance via config
- [x] Chance tremble chance via config
- [x] Change tremble move speed via config
- [ ] Change heart attack from instant kill to just damage
- [ ] Introduce extra effects for both heart attack and tremble
- [x] Use a specific cause of death that works with Coroner
- [x] Add in a chance for an adrenaline rush
- [ ] Add in alternate affects

The original mod was created by nono_t27.
I forked his project and updated the code to work with configuration files for the existing values,
and I plan to add more content in future.
